This repo contains my tasks solving a codewars kata **(only interesting kata include)**

Work flow manifest:

- Are you solving kata? Ok, but just create a branch for it

- Did you have solved kata? Ok just merge the branch into master

Every solving must contain a kata id in a doc string. Every commit needs it too
